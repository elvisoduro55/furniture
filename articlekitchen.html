    <div class="container">

        <div class="left">
           <p>If it's time for a kitchen refresh, nothing can overhaul a space quite like
             a cabinet makeover. But don't rely on a warmer shade of white to achieve a 
             new look. According to Kathryn Lott, owner and lead creative of Kathryn Lott Design,
              there's a whole technicolor world coming into focus in the kitchen, and it's time 
              to jump on the trend. "People are tired of playing it safe," says Lott.
               "We are seeing a lot more in overall color and stains for kitchen cabinets.
               " With so many shades to choose from, deciding where to start and how to narrow
                down your choices to a hue that works for you and your space can prove challenging.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="right">
             <p>  "The kitchen is almost always the focal point of every home regardless of location,
                 orientation, and layout," says Bianca Betancourt, design team lead at FORM,
                  a brand specializing in direct-to-consumer kitchen cabinetry. "This means 
                  that the color choices are very important to creating a timeless design." 
                  So where does one even begin?</p> 
            
            </div>

    <div class="container">

            <p>
                Betancourt says it's often easier for her clients to pinpoint
                what they don't like versus what they do. Even after the initial
                 likes and dislikes have been uncovered, there are still so many 
                 details that affect a kitchen cabinet color choice. 
                 "The additional elements such as pulls, countertop, backsplash, etc., 
                 are what make the kitchen unique and personalized in style," Betancourt says.
                  "It's essential to understand the surrounding architectural elements and finishes
                   in order to create a cohesive design."
                   Selecting the right kitchen cabinet colors might not be the only factor
                    in creating the kitchen of your dreams, but it can certainly set the
                     groundwork for a space that dazzles. Here, Betancourt and Lott share
                      their favorite kitchen cabinet color trends to help inspire your space.

    <h3>Black Cabinets</h3>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="left">
           <p>Black cabinets continue to grow in popularity and Betancourt
             predicts its continued traction in the coming years. 
             "Black cabinets are still very popular and I believe 
             the popularity will continue to rise as more millennials
              begin to purchase and/or renovate their homes," she says.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="right">
             <p>If choosing a black paint color sounds completely overwhelming,
                 you're not alone. Instead of going the midnight route,
                  Lott advises softening things up. "Sherwin-Williams' 
                  Iron Ore is a black that is not a deep dark black, 
                  but one that has more of a gray/blue undertone," she says.

            </div>

    <h3>Taupe and Wood Tones</h3>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="left">
           <p>No list of trending kitchen cabinet colors would be complete without
             a mention of white, but there's a new neutral on the scene that's both
              earthy and intriguing. "White cabinets will always be a classic choice. 
              However, I am beginning to replace white colors with taupe colors and occasionally 
              mixing with wood tones," says Betancourt. 
            "These color choices create a warm and inviting space with plenty of dimension."</p>

            </div>

            <div class="right">
                <img src="servicesimages/traupekitchen.jpg" width="250px" />
    
            
            </div>

    </div>

       
    <h3>Dual-Tone Cabinets</h3>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="left">
           <p>Why settle for one color when you can showcase two? "We are seeing a lot of black and white;
             white on the perimeter cabinets and black on the island," says Lott.
              And while she can get behind a coordinating island, there's another 
              two-tone trend out there that she warns against. "One of the biggest
               ideas that I see right now is people selecting different colors for 
               their base cabinets and their uppers, so they work together but don't match,"
                she says. "Don't do it. It makes the space choppy and busy."</p>

            </div>

            <div class="right">
                <img src="servicesimages/dualkitchen.jpg" width="250px" height="200px" />
            
            </div>

    </div>

        
    <h3>Dark Blue Cabinets</h3>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="left">
           <p>"Blue is still a hot color," says Lott, but think deep, dark blues instead of pastels. 
            She suggests Sherwin-Williams Naval for "a strong navy base color with major impact.
            " Rich, vibrant tones like navy and black are ideal backdrops to make hardware and other 
            kitchen elements pop. For that reason, pay attention to the undertone of your blue cabinet
             paint color and compare it to the finishes and fixtures in your kitchen before giving
             your final stamp of approval.
             You'll be glad you invested the time to create a kitchen you'll love living in for years to come.</p>
