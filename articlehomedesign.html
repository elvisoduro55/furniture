           <p>
            Clean lines, reductive, uncluttered, monochromatic, simplicity, 
            "less is more"—these are some of the terms and concepts that 
            immediately come to mind when thinking about minimalism.
             It's impossible to deny the serenity and simple beauty when 
             confronted with a resolved minimalist interior, but achieving 
             this look is more deliberate and frankly, difficult, than just
              choosing a few pieces of furniture for a white backdrop, 
              which can leave a space feeling cold, sparse and unlived-in.
               Take a look at our guide below, crafted from conversations with 
               three interior designers and two architects well-versed in designing
                simply stunning minimalist interiors; learn what the concept of
                 minimalism is to them and how they have achieved form-focused
                  interiors for their clients.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “Minimalism for me is about keeping a space simple, 
                  uncluttered and accentuating the attractive architectural 
                  features of a space. The palette is mostly monochromatic and 
                  color is used as an accent,” says Chakirath, principal 
                  designer at B Interior LLC. "I think minimalism and functionality 
                  go hand in hand. A minimalist-designed space incorporates an open
                   floor plan, lots of light, and simple line furnishings that 
                   re well-built and comfortable. All these create a soothing and 
                   inviting space that has a timeless aesthetic."

    <h3>Minimalist Architecture</h3>
    
    <div class="container">

        <div class="left">
            <p>
                While minimalist architecture also aims to condense content and 
                streamline form and structure, it has a complex language on its own.
                 "Minimalist architecture involves the use of reductive design elements,
                  without ornamentation or decoration," says Martha Annang of Martha Annang Architects.
                   "Proponents of minimalism believe that condensing the content and 
                   form of a design to its bare essentials reveals the true 'essence of architecture.'"

                   Illustrating aesthetic restraint—a key concept in formal simplicity and 
                   architectural minimalism—Martha renovated a Central Park South home built on 
                   "principles of ergonomics, functionality and sustainability." Working within a
                    space with inherited elements that could not be altered, such as the existing
                     plumbing chase (a false wall used to conceal plumbing), Martha prioritized 
                     reducing the bulk problem. "The chase has an unintended purpose—that of a visual
                      barrier, thus blocking a direct view into the workings of the busy open plan kitchen,
                   " says Martha. "New full-height upper cabinets, floor-to-ceiling pantry closets,
                     and the utilization of all under-the-counter island spaces increased the storage capacity
                      of this kitchen by twenty percent. Simplicity in design
                     and uniqueness in resolution are key to this alteration."
                    Along the same line of thinking as Martha, the idea of "essential" is 
                    imperative to minimalism as Adele of Adelaide Architects 
                    explains: "Minimalism is an approach to design where the elements of the 
                    structure are simplified to their essential components. Nothing is added for effect.
                     The design thrives on the beauty of the forms and the materials used to create 
                     the forms," she says. "The design needs to be clear and simple, but not boring.
                      This is where the use of light, form and beautiful materials is so essential. 
                      The craft of the construction is incredibly important since you cannot add trim 
                      to cover misalignments."

    <h3>Benefits of a Minimalist Space for Homeowners</h3>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="left">
           <p>The idea of uncluttered and clean space is truly a driver
             behind the minimalist movement, and the desire to seek and
              adapt its principal ideas in interior design. "If we really
               stop to think about it we do not need so many things; we can 
               live in any space with a lot less," says Martha Annang of 
               Martha Annang Interior Design. "How many sofas do we really need?
                How many chairs? Do we need to hang pictures at all on walls? 
                Maybe only on one wall? Or on none? How many knick-knacks do we
                 really need on our coffee table or shelves? In reality, we need
                  functionality and practicality that blends with no superfluous
                   embellishments. Shapes should be quite uncomplicated, and colors
                    and textures should harmoniously blend."
                    Martha also mentions the firsthand benefits she has seen from 
                    employing a minimalist design aesthetic in her projects. 
                    "I think clients are inspired by their space to focus on the
                     essentials and items of personal value," she says. 
                     "It has a calming effect to live in a well-designed and 
                     uncluttered space. We make sure to provide ample closed 
                     storage so that the architecture and interiors can be
                      uncluttered. It creates a calm haven for living."
